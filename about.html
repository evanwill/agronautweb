            <h4>The Argonaut</h4>     
            
            <p>The Argonaut is the award winning student newspaper of the University of Idaho, produced by the Department of Student Involvement <a href=" https://www.uidaho.edu/current-students/department-of-student-involvement/student-media">Student Media</a>.</p>
            <p>The first issues were released in 1889 and it has been in print ever since. It is typically published twice a week during the academic year. A treasure trove of university happenings, opinions, and local advertizements, these pages give us a glimps into the details of campus life through the century.</p>
            <p>The Argonaut complements the <a href="http://www.lib.uidaho.edu/digital/gem/index.html">Gem of the Mountain Yearbook Collection</a> and  <a href="http://www.lib.uidaho.edu/digital/campus/">Campus Photograph Collection</a> to provide a rich history of UI campus. </p>

                <blockquote><p class="quote">"At a meeting of the student body in the school year of '98-'99, it was decided to publish a college paper, and a committee was appointed to investigate the cost and to draw up a Constitution and By-Laws... ...The new paper was christened "The Argonaut, the Searcher of the Golden Fleece." It is to the sagacity and business ability of the first Editor-in-Chief, that we owe the establishment of the Argonaut upon a firm basis."

            <p>This digital collection provides access to nearly 6,000 PDFs representing each issue of the Argonaut from 1898 to 2010.

The PDFs have transcripts produced by Optical Character Recognition, allowing the full text to be searched.
