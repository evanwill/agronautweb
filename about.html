            <p>The Argonaut is the award winning student newspaper of the University of Idaho, produced by the Department of Student Involvement <a href=" https://www.uidaho.edu/current-students/department-of-student-involvement/student-media">Student Media</a>. The first issues were released in 1889 and it has been in print ever since. It is typically published twice a week during the academic year. A treasure trove of university happenings, opinions, and local advertizements, these pages give us a glimps into the details of campus life through the century.</p> 
            <blockquote><p class="quote">At a meeting of the student body in the school year of '98-'99, it was decided to publish a college paper, and a committee was appointed to investigate the cost and to draw up a Constitution and By-Laws. The committee's report was favorably received at the second meeting, and Mr. Guy W. Wolfe was elected Editor-in-Chief and Business Manager. The new paper was christened "The Argonaut, the Searcher of the Golden Fleece." It is to the sagacity and business ability of the first Editor-in-Chief, that we owe the establishment of the Argonaut upon a firm basis.
