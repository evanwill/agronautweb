            <h4>The Argonaut</h4>     
            
            <p>The Argonaut is the award winning student newspaper of the University of Idaho, currently produced by the Department of Student Involvement <a href=" https://www.uidaho.edu/current-students/department-of-student-involvement/student-media">Student Media</a>. It has been continuously in print since 1889, typically published twice a week during the academic year and distributed across campus and the town of Moscow, Idaho.</p>
            <p>A treasure trove of university happenings, opinions, and local advertizements, these pages offer us a facinating glimps into the details of campus life through the century. The Argonaut Student Newspaper digital collection complements the <a href="http://www.lib.uidaho.edu/digital/gem/index.html">Gem of the Mountain Yearbook Collection</a> and  <a href="http://www.lib.uidaho.edu/digital/campus/">Campus Photograph Collection</a> to illustrate the rich history of University of Idaho. </p>

                <blockquote><p class="quote">"At a meeting of the student body in the school year of '98-'99, it was decided to publish a college paper, and a committee was appointed to investigate the cost and to draw up a Constitution and By-Laws... ...The new paper was christened "The Argonaut, the Searcher of the Golden Fleece." It is to the sagacity and business ability of the first Editor-in-Chief, that we owe the establishment of the Argonaut upon a firm basis."
